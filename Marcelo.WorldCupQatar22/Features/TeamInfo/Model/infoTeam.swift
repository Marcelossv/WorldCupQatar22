The winners of the 2019 Asian Cup reached the semifinals of the Gold Cup and the Arab Cup in 2021 and, therefore, want to assert their command of the field in the World Cup. Recent results against the opposition released, however, that will be released most of the time."),

Their best plans are undoubtedly ahead of them, but a good World Cup in 2022 could be important for the South American team. Players to watch include Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie and Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo"),

As with his last World Cup appearance, Louis van Gaal is in charge, with the former Manchester United manager having overseen a period of stabilization following the team's struggles following the departure of Ronald Koeman in 2020. In Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt, the selection has arguably the best pairing of defenders in the competition, but they will depend on Memphis Depay to score the goals in the competition.")

The fact that players with the ability of Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham are still unsure of their starting roles shows just how strong the roster Southgate has to choose from. After a semi-final defeat in 2018 and the Euro 2020 final on penalties, the 2022 World Cup could realistically end England's 56-year wait for a major trophy."),

This time, after leading their group in the third round of the Asian Qualifiers. They have won eight of their 10 games and conceded just four goals as they did relatively light work to earn a spot in Qatar. His hopes of making it through the rounds will now likely be with Bayer Leverkusen striker Sardar Azmoun, who came out of international retirement after missing the competition in 2018."),

Despite the disappointing result in the qualifiers, Gregg Berhalter's team made their way through the final games in March. Probably one of the youngest teams in Qatar and with question marks defending against high-quality opponents, it would be asking too much for the United States to go far this time, but the signs are good for the 2026 co-hosts to be among the favorites in home next time."),

The upcoming Cup, then, presents what will likely be the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's last chance to win, and the signs are pretty positive a year into the tournament. Lionel Scaloni has overseen a change of culture since taking charge of the Albiceleste, which in turn has revitalized Messi's love for his national team and while there are doubts as to whether his defense can withstand some of the best attacks in the world, he there are enough players at the other end of the field who can decide matches."),

This will be the sixth participation of the selection, since the first classification in 1994.  Still, he will have to go further to match his debut performance, reaching the round of 16, Despite leading the last group of the qualifiers, Saudi Arabia struggled to score goals during the qualifiers, having scored only 12 times in 10 matches. That will probably be their challenge in Qatar as well."),

In fact, the question mark over this team from Mexico is whether it will be on a downward curve in Qatar. Furthermore, the team struggled to score goals throughout qualifying, scoring just 17 times in 14 matches as Raúl Jiménez has not looked like the same player since returning from his severe head injury. Recent defeats to the United States have also led to doubts about their status as Concacaf's top team."),

As might be expected, he scored in Poland's win over Sweden in the play-offs, and now they will look to learn the lessons of the last two disappointing tournaments, where they were knocked out in the group stage on both occasions. Despite that, given Lewandowski's presence, they will be the third pot team that everyone else will want to avoid.")

Kylian Mbappé and Karim Benzema have shown in recent months that they are building a formidable relationship in attack. Still, the only thing that could stop the Nations League winners in the competition is the conservative nature of their coach, Didier Deschamps."),

Kasper Hjulmand is emerging as one of the most brilliant coaches in international football, and now he has Christian Eriksen back at his disposal following the ace's triumphant return to football in the early months of 2022. Combine Eriksen's attacking prowess and Denmark's famous defense, and a shot at the playoffs isn't out of the question."),

They have already entered the competition on five of the last seven occasions, although they have not yet made it past the group stage. If they want to resist this trend in 2022, they will have to build a solid defense, but even then, that might not be enough.")

While the former Barcelona manager continues to test and change his squad from game to game, there is a sense that he is building a deep pool of players from which he can select the fittest when the World Cup rolls around. Until then, Pedri and Gavi are expected to have another 12 months of experience, while Ansu Fati may have overlooked the injury problems that have plagued him since 2020."),

The former Bayern Munich manager has won eight of the games he has played since taking charge after Euro 2020, and has seen his team score 34 goals in that span, conceding just three times. Germany are a team full of experience and while they may face a tougher group than they expected after losing a place among the top teams, they are still poised for their best tournament campaign since Euro 2016."),

Takumi Minamino, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Take Kubo are the most famous names in the current roster, and reaching the round of 16 would, again, be seen as a great achievement.")

Much will depend on Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku to pave the way for Roberto Martínez's team, being the last chance any player will have to make a big impact at a World Cup. The emergence of youngsters Jeremy Doku and Charles De Ketelaere is also exciting from an offensive point of view, although defensive weaknesses remain the team's biggest obstacle."),

The fact that they managed to pass the stage without their talisman, Alphonso Davies, will only give them more confidence to impress when they arrive in Qatar. As co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup this is the competition they are really eyeing as the one they can excel at, but they also won't be in Qatar as mere tourists."),

Only twice in their last six qualifying matches have they failed to score three goals, and have been unlucky enough to lose to Egypt in the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations. With Achraf Hakimi, they also have the most exciting young player in African football. So a favorable draw could still take them to the round of 16."),

Luka Modric continues to perform at a high level as he begins his preparations for a fourth World Cup, and the Real Madrid player will lead a team that is slowly moving away from the golden generation that once brought such success. There are some encouraging signs as youngsters such as RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol have started to take up places on the team.")

They certainly have the firepower to do so, with Dusan Vlahovic, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Luka Jovic leading an attack that has Dusan Tadic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in midfield. However, they have only had one clean sheet in eight games in the Qualifiers, so they will need to strengthen their defense throughout the competition."),

The change of coach does not appear to have crippled one of the most consistent squads in world football, and it will be the same old-timers, Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka and Yann Sommer, who will once again be considered to lead the way for this team. Don't expect them to be emotional, but expect them to reach the round of 16. It's just what they do."),

For him to make that dream a reality, the Manchester United forward will likely have to lead the way again, although he has a strong supporting cast around him that includes the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Jota and João Félix. Defensively, they are desperate for Pepe to stay in shape, although Fernando Santos' continued presence on the bench means that even if all the stars' names are available, they could still be stopped by their conservative coach."),

However, they managed to turn the tide, winning each of the final four games, allowing the likes of Luis Suárez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Godin a final chance to impress on football's biggest stage.
